         <b>Malic acid:</b>Malic acid is an organic compound with the molecular
           formula C4H6O5. It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living
            organisms, contributes to the pleasantly sour taste of fruits, and is
             used as a food additive. Malic acid has two stereoisomeric forms -L-
              and D-enantiomers-, though only the L-isomer exists naturally. The
               salts and esters of malic acid are known as malates.
          The malate anion is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle.<br><br>

        <p>
          Citric acid is a natural organic acid found in citrus fruits
           such as lemons, oranges, and limes.<br><br>

It is widely used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer, acidulant,
 and preservative due to its tart and refreshing taste.<br><br>

Citric acid is safe for consumption when used in moderation and is considered
 a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additive by regulatory agencies worldwide.

        <p>
         <b>Tartaric acid:</b> Tartaric acid is a white, crystalline organic acid that occurs naturally in many 
          fruits, most notably in grapes, but also in bananas, tamarinds, and citrus. Its salt, potassium
           bitartrate, commonly known as cream of tartar, develops naturally in the process of winemaking.
            It is commonly mixed with sodium bicarbonate and is sold as baking powder used as a leavening 
            agent in food preparation. The acid itself is added to foods as an antioxidant and to impart its
             distinctive sour taste. Tartaric is an alpha-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, is diprotic and aldaric in
              acid characteristics, and is a dihydroxyl derivative of succinic acid.<br><br>

        E551-Silicon dioxide

      </button>
      <div class="pannel">
        <p>
         <b>Silicon dioxide:</b> Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, silicic acid or silicic acid anydride is an 
          oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2, most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various
           living organisms. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand. Silica is one of
            the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and 
            as synthetic product. Notable examples include fused quartz, fumed silica, silica gel, and aerogels. It is
             used in structural materials, microelectronics -as an electrical insulator-, and as components in the 
             food and pharmaceutical industries. Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica is toxic and can lead to 
             severe inflammation of the lung tissue, silicosis, bronchitis, lung cancer, and systemic autoimmune diseases,
              such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Uptake of amorphous silicon dioxide, in high doses, leads to non-permanent
               short-term inflammation, where all effects heal.<br><br>
