          Lecithins are natural compounds commonly used in the food industry as emulsifiers and stabilizers.<br><br>

          Extracted from sources like soybeans and eggs, lecithins consist of phospholipids that enhance the mixing of
          oil and
          water, ensuring smooth textures in various products like chocolates, dressings, and baked goods.<br><br>

          Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471), are food additives commonly used as emulsifiers in various
          processed foods.<br><br>

          These compounds consist of glycerol molecules linked to one or two fatty acid chains, which help stabilize and
          blend water and
          oil-based ingredients. E471 enhances the texture and shelf life of products like margarine, baked goods, and
          ice cream, ensuring
          a smooth and consistent texture.<br><br>

          It is generally considered safe for consumption within established regulatory limits.

        <p>
          Sodium carbonates (E500) are compounds commonly used in food preparation as
          leavening agents, helping baked goods rise by releasing carbon dioxide when
          they interact with acids.<br><br>

          Often found in baking soda, they regulate the pH of food, preventing it from
          becoming too acidic or too alkaline. In the culinary world, sodium carbonates
          can also enhance the texture and structure of foods, such as noodles, by modifying
          the gluten network.<br><br>

          Generally recognized as safe, sodium carbonates are non-toxic when consumed in typical amounts found in food.

          Ammonium carbonate: Ammonium carbonate is a salt with the chemical formula -NH4-2CO3.
          Since it readily degrades to gaseous ammonia and carbon dioxide upon heating, it is
          used as a leavening agent and also as smelling salt. It is also known as baker's
          ammonia and was a predecessor to the more modern leavening agents baking soda and baking powder.
          It is a component of what was formerly known as sal volatile and salt of hartshorn.<br>
